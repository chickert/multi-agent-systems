# Multi-Agent Systems

The code in these files implements popular algorithms and concepts from multi-robot systems literature.

See the "MRTA" directory for multi-robot task allocation and the "coverage&consensus" directory for algorithms relating to multi-robot coverage and consensus. In all cases, be sure to read the comments: a variety of variations are implemented in each and only need to be uncommented to run.
